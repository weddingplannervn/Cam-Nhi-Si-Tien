**A Fairytale Wedding - Cam Nhi &amp; Si Tien**

Inspired by the soft, sweet personality of our bride Cam Nhi, we envisioned a fairytale garden wedding adorned with fresh flowers in pastel pinks and gentle purples. The delicate hues blended harmoniously to create a romantic and enchanting atmosphere for this special day.

At THO’s Wedding Planner & Decoration, we crafted a stunning backdrop with curved arches and floral gates leading to the stage, perfectly framing the event. The enchanting space transformed Phì Lũ into a dreamlike setting, where every detail—from the gallery table to the photo booth and the main ceremony stage—was meticulously arranged with vibrant colors and thoughtful design.

For Cam Nhi & Si Tien's wedding, we aimed to create an intimate and gentle atmosphere while preserving the traditional elements of a Vietnamese wedding. The result was a celebration that beautifully captured the essence of love and togetherness, leaving lasting memories for everyone involved.

THO’s Wedding Planner & Decoration was truly honored to be a part of this unforgettable day, witnessing the joy and happiness shared by both families. We wish the couple an exciting journey ahead filled with love and adventure!
